                Not all Limbless creatues are snakes, some lizards have also
                evolved.


                India is a home for 300 species of snakes out of which only
                60 species are Venomous and rest are either non-Venomous or
                Mildly-Venomous.

                Snake, (suborder Serpentes), also called serpent, any of more than 3,400 species of reptiles distinguished by their limbless condition and greatly
                elongated body and tail. Classified with lizards in the order Squamata, snakes represent a lizard that, over the course of evolution, has undergone
                structural reduction, simplification, and loss as well as specialization. All snakes lack external limbs, but not all legless reptiles are snakes.
                Certain burrowing lizards may have only front or hind limbs or be completely legless. Unlike lizards, snakes lack movable eyelids, which results in a
                continuous and often disconcerting stare. Snakes also lack external ear openings. Internally, they have lost the urinary bladder. The visceral organs
                are elongated, with reduction of the left member in relation to the right; the left lung is greatly reduced or even lost entirely. However, snakes
                possess increased numbers of vertebrae and have developed two novelties among vertebrates: a tracheal lung in the neck region and a venom-conducting
                system for subduing prey.

            <p class="te">

                Snake venom is a highly modified saliva[1] containing zootoxins that facilitate the immobilization and digestion of prey, and defense against threats.
                It is injected by unique fangs during a bite, and some species are also able to spit their venom.2]

                The glands that secrete the zootoxins are a modification of the parotid salivary glands found in other vertebrates, and are usually situated on each
                side of the head, below and behind the eye, and encapsulated in a muscular sheath. The glands have large alveoli in which the synthesized venom is
                stored before being conveyed by a duct to the base of channeled or tubular fangs through which it is ejected.

                Venoms contain more than 20 different compounds, mostly proteins and polypeptides. A complex mixture of proteins, enzymes, and various other
                substances with toxic and lethal properties  serves to immobilize the prey animal, enzymes play an important role in the digestion of prey,
                and various other substances are responsible for important but non-lethal biological effects. Some of the proteins in snake venom have very
                specific effects on various biological functions including blood coagulation, blood pressure regulation, and transmission of the nervous or
                muscular impulses, and have been developed for use as pharmacological or diagnostic tools, and even useful drugs.
